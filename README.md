# HoloLens2-AR-Apps

This Github repository consists of some AR apps I have made regarding for the Microsoft HoloLens 2. Feel free to try them out!

- **MRTK MarsRover**: This is an app where you help assemble an AR MarsRover object by inserting virtual parts scatered through the environment.

- **Virtual Objects HoloLens**: This is an app where there are certain shapes in the environment that you can manipulate (based on the HoloLens tutorials).

- **VisionApp**: This is a vision app where you can store and retreive objects with their label, location and even other characteristics (such as images). This vision app uses this stored data to train vision algorithms that can be directly accessed through the app as wel to find a certain object for example (with segmentation mask and bounding box).

- **YoloHolo**: This is an app that introduces Yolo-v2 (tiny) inside the HoloLens so that the user can see every object and their bounding box while wearing the HoloLens.
